# TODO

- the diagram doesn't show S3 but it needs to

- docs for setting up the project should be pages

- add in something that tells you bundle sizes and gives you a dependency graph

- figure out what pages to have, aka a page for estimating costs, etc.
	- a neat trick would be to have this in some spreadsheet, so you could generate a page that you'd have available like `docs.braidedjs.com/pricing` and when you fork this you'd plug in your values

- ideally like you run `npm run dev` and it stands up the whole service
	- need to figure out locally running Workers
	- need to figure out locally running DynamoDB
